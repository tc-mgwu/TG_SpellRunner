{"name":"Spell Runner","tagline":"A fast-paced mobile game to practice spelling while improving text speed and accuracy","body":"# Gameplay\r\nPlayers will spell out words as fast as they can to make the wizard cast spells and run away. The amount of damage dealt and how fast the wizard runs away depends on how fast and accurately the word is spelled. If the player spells five words perfectly the first time, then the next word will generate a combo attack which will allow the wizard to stun the monster for 5 seconds longer-allowing the player to gain more distance from the monster by spelling additional words. If the player misspells a word, the cool down to try again will be 1 second. This game is a constant runner, but will feature different difficulty settings to tailor the words to specific grade levels. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
